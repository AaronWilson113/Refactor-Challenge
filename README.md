# Refactor-Challenge

The Refactored code in this repository is from a webpage designed by Horiseon. Nothing about the webpage itself was changed but the html and css was modified. The modifications include changes to the css format, the semantic html, and different id and class elements. The purpose of the code refactor was to make the html and css more digestible as well as remove any redundant css and improve general structure and organization.
